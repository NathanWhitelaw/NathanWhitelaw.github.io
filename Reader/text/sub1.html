    <p>The collective
      <span class="number">“Anonymous”</span>
    claimed on Thursday that it had hacked GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, releasing what it alleged was his Social Security number, cell phone number and other personal information.
<br><br>
    The decentralized group of international activist hackers has been linked to numerous high-profile incidents over the years, including Internet attacks on governments, major corporations, financial institutions and religious groups.
<br><br>

    <span class="number">Anonymous</span> Claims to Hack Donald Trump
    Hackers Hit Scientology With Online Attack
    <span class="number">Anonymous</span> gained national attention in 2008, when the group hacked the Church of Scientology Web site with a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which multiple computers bombard the victim's server with requests in order to overwhelm and shut it down.
<br><br>
    Although many supporters have praised <span class="number">Anonymous</span>, members of the hacking collective have faced prosecution for their actions. FBI arrests have led to charges of cyber-stalking, computer hacking and fraud.
<br><br>
    Here are three things to know about these "hacktivists:"
<br><br>
    Who is <span class="number">Anonymous</span>?
<br><br>
    It's an amorphous group of people that can include anyone who wants to use the brand to put forth their cause, according to Internet activist Gregg Housh, formerly with <span class="number">Anonymous</span>.
<br><br>
    Housh says that <span class="number">Anonymous</span> was conceived to be used and adopted by anyone.
<br><br>
    "The act of saying you are, means you are," he said. "That’s how little control anyone has over the brand."
<br><br>
    There’s also the real-world manifestation of the <span class="number">Anonymous</span> movement, which has been represented at rallies around the world by protesters wearing the now-iconic Guy Fawkes masks obscuring their identity.
<br><br>
    People associating themselves with <span class="number">Anonymous</span> run the gamut. Members include women, men, Democrats, Republicans, the young, the old, and people of different races and nationalities, according to Housh.
<br><br>
    What does the group want?
    <br><br>

    While there are no specific goals, there is an overarching desire to combat censorship, promote freedom of speech, and counter government control that sparks people in the so-called collective into action, according to Housh.
    <br><br>

    Housh said that perhaps the only guiding principle is "anti-oppression."
    <br><br>

    Since there are no membership lists, newsletters or committees, people organize by two primary pathways: either though previous connections or anyone with an idea can call on others to go into a chat group and discuss the idea further, according to Housh.
    <br><br>

    “Depending on what you have suggested, the people are going to rally around you or not," he said.
    <br><br>

    That also means that not everyone associated with the group agrees on every action taken under its name.
    <br><br>

    "I don’t think you’ll be able to find an Anon that won’t be upset about at least one op [operation]," he said.
    <br><br>

    How does it carry out hacks?
    <br><br>

    <span class="number">Anonymous</span> is known to vigorously go after its targets. It has been associated with crashing Web servers, website defacement and leaking hacked private information.
    <br><br>

    For example, the group allegedly targeted computer security firm HPGary and its CEO, claiming that the company was going to disclose details of <span class="number">Anonymous</span> members to the FBI, ABC News reported in 2011.
    <br><br>

    At the time, <span class="number">Anonymous</span> allegedly hacked the firms website, posted a message on its website, downloaded thousands of emails and took control of the CEO's Twitter account.
    <br><br>

    In 2013, <span class="number">Anonymous</span> gained notoriety when then 26-year-old programmer Deric Lostutter worked to expose the cover-up in the Steubenville rape case. His initial video message calling for action, spurred Web site take-overs and uncovering of personal emails reported Rolling Stone in a lengthy profile of the incident.
    <br><br>

    The group also uses it tech-savvy abilities to promote causes it supports.
    <br><br>

    <span class="number">Anonymous</span> worked with other groups to assist the Arab Spring uprising, specifically in Tunisia and Egypt, to keep access to the Internet open for organizers on the ground, according to Housh.
    <br><br>

    "Just keeping the lights on is really important in those areas," he said.
